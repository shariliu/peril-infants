# Sensitivity to risk in infants' intuitive psychology

## Overview

Infants assume that agents plan over variables like physical effort and reward (Liu et al., 2017). This research asks whether infants consider the perils agents plan over as well. Here, peril is defined as degree of danger, or the magnitude of a negative state that an agent might encounter (falling down a cliff).

In one set of experiments, we ask whether infants expect agents to minimize the peril of their actions, all else being equal. We do this by showing infants an agent choosing a more vs less dangerous action for the same reward, and vice versa, and measuring their looking times to assess their expectations.  

In another set of experiments, we ask whether infants infer the value of a goal from the amount of danger an agent withstood in pursuing it.
