# Dangerous ground: One-year-old infants are sensitive to peril in other agents' action plans

This README file contains the data and analyses required to reproduce the above paper (currently in submission). In this revision, we have decided to split the data from two age groups, 10mo infants, and infants 1y of age and older, and report them in separate experiments. 

The manuscript reporting the results from older and younger infants separately, and the data/analyses from that paper are found in the path `analyses/10mo_1yo_separate/`. In this path, there is a subfolder called `exp1_fam_csvs`. That folder contains the data and scripts for a supplemental analysis reported in the paper.
